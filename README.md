# Audio-Processing
This is one of my dream project to build a translator model.

The idea behind this is to use the movies data (audio (tamil) and subtitle text (english)) present to create a translator using neural networks. 

The big audio wave file is split into small chunks based on subtitle data. All these data is then fed into a neural network model to create a translator.

# Status :
Currently I am struck with not having much processing power to create the neural network model. Will soon continue on this.
