
Evening, after rain.... 
Cool gentle breeze is going away touching you. 
Your memory takes you back to the days you thought have lost it.
Wait please. Don't close your eyes.... 
This film is a mirror of your younger days. 
Egmore Railway station, Chennai. 
Hi, I am Senthil. 
I am running an Advertising company in Chennai. 
I am going to marry on coming February 12th. 
I am now going to invite. 
I have a desire. 
My school friends, 
My Teachers, 
Friends, who were responsible for my progress. 
I want to invite all of them to my marriage. 
I am going on that mission only. 
Pandian Express will leave shortly. 
Tomorrow morning I will be in my native village. 
I will take leave now, bye. 
You must attend my marriage without fail...okay. 
Neikaranpatti- Dindigul District. 
Passengers to Neikaranpatti, get down. 
Memories are rolling back. 
Teamed memories buried deep in my heart are surfacing.

Like... I have lost something,   like... I am born again, 

like my mother took care of me   ...in the corners of the eyes. 
 ....tears are rolling down.  
 AYNGARAN DVD  
 Sky is overcast.  
 Trees swaying in the breeze is natural.  
But when Kovalan & Kannagi enter Madurai Kovalan will be unjustly killed.
Kovalan will be killed later. 
Then, when Kovalan enters Madurai, he will be killed.

So, the trees swayed as if to warn him not to enter Madurai.
Come my lord...come. 
It seems you shaped your moustache in the alley. 
Have you become a Lord? 
Hey stop....stop. 
Where are you running away? - No father...no. 
Will you sport a moustache? - Father, no... 
You have shown no interest in your studies for all these years,
and you are interested in sporting a moustache? 
When daughter grows up, her mother becomes an old woman.

When moustache sprout on son's lip his father becomes an old man.
Your father is still a young man. 
 Couldn't recognize you at all?  
Are you all doing fine? 
I have come all the way from there to meet you all.
Are you fine sunny? - I am fine. 
Are you fine, sunny? - I am fine. 
Are you postman Pandian's son? - Yes. 
I saw you as a little boy. 
Are your parents fine? - They are fine. 
They always talk about you all. 
Are you still studying? 
No, I have finished my studies and presently working.
Memories are coming back. 
the first dragonfly I had caught, 
the first toy watch I stole in the festival, 
the first Malabar beedi I smoked, 
my first savings, 
my first movie in a touring theatre, 
the first kabaddi (sport) match I won. 
the first house I grew up in the village, 
the first community lunch we prepared, as boys, 
the first railway journey, 
first cries on a friend's death. 
They haven't come yet. They will come. 
Why are you sitting here? Aren't you going? 
Wait, let girls from Kammapetti come. We will go together.

Oh! That's the thing! Have you finished Math's home work?
They are coming. 
Look, they are coming... 
Be careful, bad signals. 
Maths Teacher has an eye on her. She may complain to him.
Look, they are coming in a group. 
Aren't you coming to school, Senthil? 
You carry on, I will come with Kammapettai boys. 
Okay, he's sold on some girl, come let's go. 
Senthil, it's going to be 9 a.m. Aren't you coming to school?
Boys from my village haven't come yet. 
I will come with them. You carry on.- Really? Yes, get lost you fool.
You are a fool to wait here. 
Kamala is coming on a cycle. 
Aren't you coming to school? Taking a day off? 
No, I was waiting for you. 
What cheek! 
Is it a new cycle? Do you know to ride cycle also? 
No, I know to pedal. 
Shall I get on the cycle? 
What a great wish! 
It will be trouble if any one sees us together. 
Don't you've a cycle?- No. 
You've brought, haven't you? 
I will ask my father to buy a cycle for me.- Why? 
Only then I can come to school with you. 
Poor thing! You are coming running. I will also walk along with you.
Do you know what is my mother's name?- What? 
Kamala. 
That's why are you smiling whenever you look at me?
What did you have in the morning?- Gruel. 
I also had gruel. 
To go with it? 
Pickle.- I too had pickle. 
You are very beautiful. 
Get lost. 
Cuckoo! 
Yes, cuckoo. 
Senthil, I will go to school with you only. 
You go. I will come late. 
I will also go late. 
Today I am not going to school. - I am also not going.
If you don't go now, 
I will push you on the ground and bite your neck. 
Isn't this a ruse to come with Kammapettai Kamala? 
Wait, I will tell your father about this. 
I will tell Kamala's father too. 
I will smash your face. 
Our cycles have had flat tyres together. 
Doesn't it mean we both are thick friends? 
Mad boy! 
I knew if my cycle had a flat tyre, your cycle will also have it.
That's why, I was waiting here for you. 
Why are you pushing the cycle? 
Flat tyre, father. 
Flat tyre! 
It's getting late to school. You take my cycle. 
I will get the cycle repaired and deliver it in the school. Hold this.
Take your lunch box. 
Which place are you from? 
Neikaranpatti. 
Whose son are you? 
Post master Pandian's son. 
Why are you pushing the cycle? 
My cycle has a flat tyre. 
Will both the cycles have flat tyres together often?
No, it happened only today. 
Hey...you.- I am getting late to school. 
If your cycle has a flat tyre in future... 
Senthil! it seems your girl friend   has attained puberty. 

That's why, she didn't   attend school. 

Without knowing it you waited all day   like a fool. 
I thought you will be sitting near the bridge. 
Why are you sitting here? 
What's it Senthil? 
Why? 
Best wishes on attaining puberty. 
Oh no! 
Mad boy! Won't I feel shy if you tell me all this? 
Memories are coming back. 
My first swimming lessons, my first cycle ride, 
my first kindergarten school teacher, Mallika. 
Getting beaten up by my father for the first time. 
First time I got scared on seeing god. 
first time, I had admired the beauty of rainbow. 
my first moustache, 
my first love, 
my first love letter, 
my first kiss, 
memories are coming back. 
Silence! 
Shut up. 
Why are you laughing at me? 
Won't your parents fart? 
You say. 
Country prospered under King Ashoka. 
Ashoka planted trees on the road sides 
and dug up ponds in all villages. - Stop it. You sit down.
Why did he plant trees? 
Subramani, answer the question. 
If travelers suddenly feel like answering the nature's call.
There won't be anything to go behind, 
so, he planted trees to go behind them to answer nature's call.
Silence please. 
What had I asked and what you are replying? 
Show me your hand. - Sir.....sir...sir. 
Oh god...Leave it...leave it. 
Bloody farting teacher. 
If you come to school again, I will break your legs.
I had asked why he had planted trees 
and he says it is for answering nature's call. 
What I had taught you and what he had replied. 
Senthil, you read now. 
When he reads, repeat after him and read loudly. You read.
In Indian society... 
for the rejuvenation, 
in the 19th century,- Read loudly. 
social reformers who were born.. 
Why did you stop reading? Why? Why are you laughing now?

I told her not to make whole pulses grary, she never cares.

Come, the last bell has been rung. I am not coming, you go.
Why? 
I have failed in 3 subjects. 
My father refused to sign the progress report. 
Mad girl! Why are you angry about it? - What else can I do?
Anyway I have to cane hits. 
Shall I put your father's signature? How will you do it?

I have been putting my father's signature for past 2 years.
Give it to me. 
You can't, leave it.- As if it's a great Governor's signature.
No please...no.- I will. 
One of you have cheated and committed a blunder. 
If he/she accepts it on their own before I find it,
I will not beat him/her. 
If I find it myself, I will thrash him/her. 
Before I finish counting 3, accept your mistake. 
Or else...I have soak the cane in water. 
One....two.... 
Forgive me sir. 
Don't beat me. 
I had warned him not to do it. 
Senthil put my father's signature on the progress report.
Has he become a great man? Come on, get up. 
It's a crime to put your father's signature. 
Did you put her father's signature? 
Are you her father?- No sir. Is he your father?- No.

Why did you sign? Show me your hand... Come on. Come on take the punishment.
Come on show your hand. 
Why are you crying? 
Don't make me go mad. Why are you shouting when I beat her?
Silence...I will kill you all. 
Show me your hand...Come on... 
Sorry Senthil, I didn't disclose wantonly. 
I cracked up in fear. 
Sorry. 
No problem Kamala. 
He has beaten me. 
If he had beat you, you wouldn't have been able to bear it.
Is it paining too much? 
Kamala, will you give if I ask you something? 
What? 
School Annual Day is coming. - Yes. 
I am donning a female's role in disguise competition.
Why are you laughing? 
Don't make fun of me? 
Really! 
I want your long skirt & jacket. - What? 
Mine? Oh no! I will not give my dress. 
Can't you use your mother's or sister's dress? 
I don't have sisters. 
My mother's jacket will be too big. 
I will not give my dress. 
Girls will make fun of me if they come to know it is my dress.
I will not tell anyone. 
If I wear the dress which you had worn once... 
it will be little embarrassing for me. 
Don't worry I will get it washed in a laundry. 
Look at his face! 
Please...give...please. 
I will give you, but don't tell anyone.- I will not tell anyone.
If you do I will... 
It enough if you give it. 
How to wear this?- How can I know? Am I a woman? 
You wanted to don a female's role, so wear it yourself.
What? 
Come here. 
Everyone is watching us. You are embarrassing me. 
What?- Your upper cloth. 
Oh!- Okay. 
How do I wear it? 
Give me. 
Hey Krishna come. 
Next it's disguise competition for students. 
First Ravana. Go & call Senthil. 
Kamala is helping Senthil 
n wearing the dress. 
Shall I tell his mother? 
- Take this. 
Why have you tucked in everything like this? 
He looks like a real girl in that dress. 
Don't move stand steady. 
I am feeling ticklish. 
Didn't you get any other role for disguise? 
Look, it's not holding. - How can it? 
Senthil, take these coconut shells. 
Use them & come quickly. 
Will it hold if I use these shells? 
Oh no! Do it yourself. 
Do it yourself. 
The first seeds of love were sown in those schools days.

I didn't know then that the affection for Kamala was love.
I was flying away freely like a butterfly. 
A thunder struck me. 
That was the last day we finished our 10th class exams.
My life's first separation. 
I like your smile very much. 
Will you give it to me? 
Oh! You have given it to me immediately. 
Don't you like anything in me? - I will take it myself...
What's it?- I will not tell you. 
Why? 
Smile please. 
Students smile! 
Students will laugh only if you fart. 
Don't make me remember that. 
Happy...happy. 
I will go...- Okay go. 
Look there! Sehthil is coming. 
We will go & get autographs from others. 
You stay here only. 
Romeo has come. 
You will come to this school to study Plus 2, won't you?
My father will not allow. 
He will stop my studies saying women don't need further education.
Studying 10th class is itself an achievement. 
I will not come to school next year. 
Boys are really lucky. 
Next year, they will marry me off to somebody. 
Don't cry, Senthil. 
Won't I be able to see you again?- No. 
We are going Kamala. Are you coming? 
I will come. 
I will go, Senthil. 
Kamala, where is your tassel? 
Father, don't beat me.- Will you take money from cash box again?
If you steal again..... - Father, don't beat me. 
Will you steal? - Don't beat me father. 
Who are you? 
Friend!- Friend? 
Do you have such a grown up friend? 
That's why are you stealing money? 
Tell me, where have hidden the money? Bloody rogue! Tell me.
Why are you beating the child? 
Who are you man?- Your friend. 
My friend?- Yes. 
I am Senthil, who used to wait at the bridge for Kammapettai Kamala.
You'd escaped all these years from marriage. 
You were in the village. Why did you shift to this place?
What else could I do? 
After my father's death, 
I couldn't continue agriculture as I didn't know it.
I must work to earn. I was married & had kids. 
For my livelihood, I had be settle here. 
How are our friends? 
I haven't meet any one of them. All are in different corners.
Occasionally we may run into each other. 
I must invite all of them. 
Do you still remember all of them? 
How can I forget? 
Do you still remember Kamala? 
Did you meet her? 
Long time back I met her in Palani. She was with her husband & kids.
That's all, after that I haven't met her. 
Where is she married? 
Near Palani...Ayakudi. ..that's the place. 
Ayakudi! 
Villagers dream of travelling by flight. 
You've come from city and desire to travel by horse carriage.
You're sentimental, Senthil. 
How long these horse carriages will be on the roads?

Next generation will know about them only from history books.
Hey, our Narayana sir.- What? 
That's our farting teacher. 
Pull over please... 
Sir greetings. 
Who are you? I am not able to recognize you. 
Sir, I am Senthil and he is Subramani. 
We studied in the 10th class under you. Do you remember us?
Is it?- Yes sir. - Very happy to see you. 
What are you doing now? 
I run an advertisement agency in Chennai. 
He is a cable guy here.- Yes? 
Are you fine sir? 
Happy. I am fine.- Yes sir. 
You have remembered us and come here to invite us. 
I am happy about. 
Boys going along the road make fun of me. 
I am very happy to meet you sir. 
I am marrying...in Chennai. 
Don't mistake me for inviting you on the road. 
You must come to my marriage sir. 
Sir, you must come definitely. - Happy to hear that.
Bless me.- Sir, bless me also. 
All these years you were... 
So far sir had done that...now... 
My wife prepared whole pulses gravy ...that's why. 
This house?- Let's inquire. 
Who's there in the house? 
Who's that? 
Is it Kamala's house? 
Didn't I ask who's that? 
Is Kamala at home? 
I asked if Kamala is at home, she's coming here. 
She's Kamala! 
Who's that? 
I am Kamala. 
What has brought you here? 
I am Senthil. 
I studied with you in 10th standard. - Do you recognize me?
Oh yes! Senthil! It has been so long! 
Come in...why are you standing there? 
Come in. 
You come this side. I will be back soon. 
Come in... 
Come Senthil...sit down. 
How did you remember me after all these years? 
How are you?- I am fine. 
Oh no! I forgot. I will bring some water for you. 
Are you all Kamala's children? 
Which standard are you studying? 
I am studying 3rd & he is in 1st. 
Have some water, Senthil. 
I couldn't believe myself. 
Where are you? 
You have changed a lot. I couldn't recognize you. I am very happy.
I am living in Madras. 
Why have you become like this? 
I am fine. Look here, I am a mother of 3 children. 
I have grown old. I will look like this only. 
Their father has come. 
Father, buy us chocolates. - Okay. I'll buy. Keep quiet.
Who are they? 
I was about to send someone to call you. 
He is my 10th classmate. 
He is Senthil and he is Subramaniam. Greetings.- Greetings.
He is my husband. 
It's okay. Did you give them something to drink? 
Will you go & buy something? - Go & bring the vessel.
Will you have coffee or cold drinks? 
I don't take cold drinks. 
Will you have coffee? I'll bring it. 
Cook fast.- I will be back soon. 
I'll buy eggs & come. 
Why are you standing? Sit down... 
Sit down Senthil.- It's alright. 
I will cook. You must eat & go. 
No thanks. I'll have to go... - Okay. 
No...I'll cook in no time. 
What's it boy? 
What's your name?- Senthil. 
Wow! My name is also Senthil. 
Boy! What's your name? - Suresh. 
Got it? There was someone by the name of Suresh before you.
You are becoming very emotional. 
There will be hundreds of Senthil in the city. 
Stupid! How could you be.... 
You must definitely come to my marriage. 
Is your marriage in Madras? - Yes. 
We have never been to Madras. We don't know how to come.

I have asked Subramani to bring you all to Madras.- Yes, I'll take you there.
We all can go together. 
No. It's too long. I'll try. Have coffee. 
The reason why I've invited you all after so many years,
is because I want you all to attend my marriage. 
You must come with your family. 
I'll make a move. 
Now, I am going to Kerala. 
Since my father was a post master, he often used to get transferred.
My entire college life was in Kerala. 
A new language. ALAPUZHA- KERALA STATE 
New people. 
New culture. 
I thought Kamala is the first and the last girl in my life.
I had preserved my unsaid love as a treasure. 
and this is the place where many changes took place in me.
I couldn't understand the mysteries of life then. 
Greetings sir. 
Greetings.- Greetings. 
Sir, I am postman Govindakutty. 
Are you the new postmaster who has come here to take charge with your family.
We are here to welcome you. 
We came by boat just now.Immediately they're taking us another boat.

Aren't we catching many buses to go to a place in our village. It's like this here.
Sir, this is the post office and the house. 
You will get all the things nearby. 
Why did he leave me & go? 
Aren't they taking Tamilians in the boat? 
How am I going to do my college in this place? 
Oh god! 
Good voice.- Thanks. I like you. 
Daily this same route? - Yes this way only. 
When did you come here? - I came here when I was in 10th. class.
It's so tough to speak malayalam at the beginning. 
When and at what age did you come here? 
You rascal! I was telling that only for so long. What were you doing?
Have you finished? - Hey, did you hear or not? 
Now tell me, when and at what age did you come here?

Do you regularly go to your village? - Hey rascal! Is it fair on your part?

Hey, don't squeeze it. Pimples are natural at this age.
Somebody is watching you very intently. 
I think some girl is ogling at you. 
 AYNGARAN DVD  
Oh mind, are you fine? 
Are the changes in you true? 
I experienced new pleasures. 
You tell me the fact, what happened? 
Why did you bring changes in me? 
I lost myself the moment I saw her. 
Senthil is keeping on looking at you. 
No, he is a poor fellow. Let him stand there. 
He appears to be a good person. 
Okay, what happened to the matter I had told you told about?
Lathika, come. 
There is space here, come fast. 
Get in. 
You go. I'll come later. - I think he is mad. 
If he comes behind you again, then I'll surely bash him.
You mind your business. 
Didn't I tell you that he follows you? 
You go. 
Hello Senthil! Why are you coming this way? 
Your house is there. Why are you coming this way? 
Are you asking me why I am on coming this way? 
Postman's house is there... I am going to see him. 
If that professors takes that class, I'll go mad. 
Then why did you take the course in which you are not interested.

What to do? I selected this course because you had selected it.
Now I have to manage it somehow. 
Who is that? 
Inspite of my asking, are you going away silently? 
Come here. 
Don't you hear me? Come here. 
Who are you? Can't recognize you? 
I am post master's son! - Oh Tamilian! 
Uncle, he is my classmate, our postmaster's son. 
Don't be afraid. We are rearing these elephants. 
They will not trouble anybody. 
Hai Rekha! Good morning. - Good morning. 
Senthil is sincerely writing something. 
Hey move a little and sit. 
Senthil, what are you writing? - Chemistry assignments.
Senthil, have you finished writing? - Yes. 
Then give me, I want to copy it. - This one! 
You will not be able to follow my handwriting. 
That's not a problem. It's enough if I understand it.
I have written it in Tamil. 
Tamil?- Yes.- Don't lie okay. 
Have you written it in Tamil in an English medium college?
Then, let me see please. 
You want to see my Tamil.- Yes, first like that, let me see how you've written.
Please, let me see it. - I will show you later. 
I will show you later. 
Senthil stop. 
Please don't. I will show you later. - Show me. 
No, I have written it in English only. 
First you told me that you've written in Tamil. 
Now you are saying it's in English. - Please no....I'll show it later.

Why are you lying unnecessarily? - I will show it later.

Let me see it. What's there to hide in it? - I said show.
I love Lathika. 
Please listen to me. 
Love which blossoms at the 1st sight isn't called love.
That's infatuation. 
That is, when I feel like loving you, 
when you disturb me in my dreams. 
When I like your character and start liking only you.
When you win over my heart 
and when I am ready to come behind you. 
only then, I will accept your love. 
Sorry. 
I don't understand whether she's shouting at me or accepting my love.
Hey remove that. 
It's very difficult for me to manage without knowing malayalam.
I can't understand even if somebody rebukes me. 
How will they shout here? - It depends upon the persons.
Some say 'poda patti' (go away you dog) 
Some say Prandhu(mad). 
Normally they address as 'pandi'. 
What's pandi? Okay leave that. 
These are very short. What are the big words they use to use for scolding?

Who scolded you? Lathika?- Oh god no! No. - Hey tell me the truth...

I first asked you thinking that will be useful for me in future.
Be careful. She is from an affluent family. 
Have you expressed your love to her? 
No, I didn't express it verbally but I had written and shown to her.- What?
She saw whatever I had written it in my book. 
What did she say? 
She said something. 
She delivered a speech and went away. I couldn't follow.
Then do one thing.- What? 
Take this walkman. 
Record it immediately, you express your love to her tomorrow.
Let's find out. 
Attention! Stand at ease. 
Dear students. 
This year also we are conducting a camp on the occasion of temple festival.
Our college is incharge of it. 
As told, all of you split into groups and mind your work.
I love you. 
Didn't I tell you that love should evolve from our hearts.

When I feel like loving you. When you disturb me in my dreams.

When I like your character and start liking only you.

When you win over my heart and I am ready to come behind you.
Only then...I'll accept your love...got it?. 
Hey Senthil..- I'll pass urine & come. 
What man? Have you recorded the speech?- Hear it is.
Wait. 
What man?- Wait.... 
Hear... 
Oh god cassette! 
Where's the cassette? Only then I'll be able to hear it.
I think you'll go mad for 10 days. 
Wait till the semester holidays are over. 
If we fall in love. 
Even if our inmorta's house is in the next street. 
We'll feel as though we are in Pakistan. 
Passing each and every minute without her. 
We'll feel like taking 100 persons to rotate the needle of the clock.
After expressing my love 
and when I couldn't understand her reply. How would I feel?
She has gone home for semester holidays. 
Though I know that she'll be back in a week. 
Unable to bear her separation. 
I used to go around the house where she wasn't present.
I have also done all such foolishness. 
When will they come? 
Why? 
Elephants are starving. There's nobody to feed them.

I don't know anything. - You needn't know anything, you sweep.
What are you saying? 
It's raining heavily. 
Hey, why hasn't Lathika turned up yet? 
We came together, but you are asking me. 
Hey Senthil, come. 
Hey Lathika! - Hey Lathika come fast. 
Lathika, what's the occasion today? 
Today is my birthday. - Birthday wishes. 
Happy Birthday. 
Wish you happy Birthday Lathika. - No chocolates? 
Hey hold this. I'll be back now. 
Where are you going in the rain? 
What Senthil?- Wish you a Happy Birthday. 
Are you going across the shore? 
What'll you get me on your return? 
What'll you get me handful? 
On the 14th night, in the milky moon... 
apple.... 
Very sweet. 
Tamil language was originated during ancient period.
Have it and then talk in Tamil. 
What? 
You....I...apple. 
Come here. 
I considered us like Adam & Eve. 
Oh god! 
Dear students, temple function will take place here after a week.

Approximately 3 1/2 lakhs of devotees are taking part in it.
It's our duty to give them a good hospitalities. 
Hello...I feel like telling you something. 
But I don't know how to break the ice. 
You got engraved in my heart. 
I myself don't know what I am doing. 
You came in my dream at night and embraced me. 
Senthil, I... 
I love you. 
Excellent! So this is it! 
Okay Senthil. 
What did she say? 
As I said you got engraved in my heart. 
So I myself don't know what I am doing. 
You came my dream last night and embraced me. 
Senthil, I love you. 
I am love with you. 
Look at his happiness. 
Did your heart feel thirsty? Yes. 
Did you get the fragrance of peace feather? - Yes. 
Did you yearn to learn Tamil? - Yes. 
Did you get the shyness of Tamilnadu? - Yes. 
Did something like magnet pulled your heart and chanted 'Love'?
My heart felt thirty?- Did it? 
I got the fragrance of peacock feathers. - Did you?
I yearned to learn Tamil. - Did you? 
I got the shyness of Tamilnadu. - Did you? 
Like a magnet something pulled my heart and chanted 'Love'.

You would've kept only the dots and forgotten to draw the design.
Yes.... 
You would've read the book upside down. 
Yes... 
You would've admired the beauty of crescent moon. 
You would've been fascinated by me by chanting my name 100 times a day.

I lost one of my anklets and my thoughts didn't direct me to search it.
Nothing wrong.... you needn't worry. 
That's the effect of love which had enveloped you. 
Will you go out of my desires & thoughts? 
Will any problem crop up? 
When the flowers in the garden start blossoming. 
Oh breeze, will you tell me what is the experience of that pleasure.
Both of us know the language of eyes and love. 
Life's success is here only. 
May 2 loving hearts live long. 
I wish for loneliness and peace. 
I feel like dancing 'Kathakali'. I am crazy about it.

I'll learn the spell of talking through eyes sooner.
You'll shout at yourself by looking at the clock. 
My toe fingers are agitated. 
I don't know whether the agitation will subside if you put the toe-ring on them.
Violence is taking place between our youth. 
It's laughing that there's nobody to question it. 
Why am I committing silly mistakes when I see you? 
Hey, are you ogling at some other girl, in my presence.
I didn't ogle at her.- Then? - She's a Tamilian. 
How did you find out? - From her nose pin. 
It looks very graceful to see Tamil girls wearing nose pins.
Did you see? 
It's not good. It's gone dry. - How to eat this dry 'puttu'?
Senthil, I don't know what happened? 
Lathika's nose is bleeding. 
Where is Lathika? - There...she has lost little blood also.
What's this? 
Do I look graceful like Tamil girls? 
You look very pretty. 
Yes father. 
Yes father, there was a phone call for you from Thamburan's house.

It seems he wants to meet you immediately. Go and meet him.
Thamburan? Why? 
Thumburan! 
Is nobody at home? - Nobody is here. 
All have gone out. 
Did you get scared that father's going to threaten you after knowing our affair?
Father will take 3 hours to return. 
I felt like being with you, that's why I called you.
All of them have come to know about our affair. 
Madhavan has told about our affair to father. 
They made a bif fuss when they saw me wearing this nose pin.
Father asked me to remove it. 
But I was very adamant. 
I'm terribly scared Senthil. 
Shall I come with you? 
You don't be afraid. Okay. 
Oh god! 
Shall I teach you to play Veena? 
Here...this first. 
This here? 
Do both of them alternately like that? 
Do it together?- Alternatively. 
Do that also. 
Right?- Yes. 
That's it. 
I can't get it. - You'll get it...play. 
I am not getting it. 
Do I've to teach you? 
I am not getting it. - You'll get it. 
Why are you closing the door? 
Post office is closed today. 
Why? Closed? 
Not only today, but till the new post master joins.
Only this post office will be closed. 
Hey....why are you taking all these things? 
Hey move. 
Hey, who are you people? 
Why have you broken inside the house and creating a scene?
I'll call the police. 
Hubby... 
Hey, why are you pushing me? 
Senthil, look at them. 
Hey, leave. 
Hey don't hit him. 
Why are you hitting him? 
Please don't hit him, I beg of you. 
Please leave him...Please... 
Are you aspiring for Thamburan's daughter being a Tamilian?
I'll cut your legs. 
You Tamilian dogs! 
Like cowards, you are hitting me from behind. 
Memories will continue. 
Coimbatore. 
Since my heart is filled with your remembrances, 
I'm burning my heart. 
Since my eyes have imprinted your image, 
I'm erasing it with my tears. 
You forgot me for your parent's sake, 
you've thrown my love like a waste paper. 
Oh woman! You can only do it. 
I'm unable to do it. 
I hate myself. 
Hey did you smoke? 
Do you've that habit? Oh god, what's this wound? 
Why're you doing like this? - Sister-in-law leave him...
you go inside. 
Brother, why're you crying for this? 
The person who has failed in love, 
will grow beard, get boozed and he'll lie on the road.
He has only smoked, didn't he? 
I was used to wait for you for a long time, 
I had taken a lot of trouble to express my feelings.
In order to make you love me, 
I took lot of pain to learn your mother tongue. 
Death is refusing to take me in to its arms. 
Language is becoming a handicap, and it's torching my silence.
I can't even breathe. 
There's no one to read me. 
Senthil, do you think what you're doing is right? 
Who told you that liquor will relieve you of your worries?

Since you didn't get your girl whom you had loved for 2 years,
you're drinking liquor... 
we're worried about the person whom we have brought up for 20 years,

If we also start drinking to get rid of it, will you bear it?
Shall I drink? 
Look, I'll tell one way to forget her. Will you listen to me?
If you want to forget something, 
you should start concentrating on things which you like.
You should love that thing. 
You should have a aim in your life. 
I want my son. 
Till we die, you're our only support. 
My responsibility is to show you a good path. 
Sorry dad... 
You shouldn't cry. 
I had written a brief letter to the Govt. that I can't work there anymore.
There's an enquiry about it. 
I'll go and attend it. 
Have tiffin and go. 
Have you prepared?- Yes madam. 
Someone from Kerala has come. You come and see him.
From Kerala? 
Lathika has recorded her talk, listen. 
Senthil, how are you? 
My father took me saying "let's go to the temple", 
but he deceived me and performed my marriage. 
Senthil, what could I do against him? 
If I had known about my father's treachery, 
I would've eloped with you. 
Now is it possible? 
I tried even to commit suicide. 
In this one month of our separation, 
the statues of the temple... 
the first kiss which you gave me... 
The thing which makes me remember you always is.. 
this nose pin! 
Your eyes will always watch me. 
Senthil, all these remembrances are worrying me a lot.
You'll also be worried like me, right? 
If I think about it, I'm also.... 
But without worrying about me, you should chart out your future.
You should be happy wherever you are. 
I'll also pray that you should be happy. 
Since my family members went out of station, 
I've to do all the household chores. 
Today you're going to eat what I prepare. 
How is Lathika? 
You haven't still forgotten her?! 
I'm not remembering her often. 
Sometimes.. 
Is she fine? - Yes, ofcourse. 
Does she ask about me? 
After I had met you in Coimbatore, 
she used to come and ask about you frequently. 
Then she stopped asking about you. 
I'm also not seeing her these days. 
Sometimes if I go to the temple I'll see her. 
There's a lot of change in you since I saw you in coimbatore.
You've joined an advertising company... 
and leading a luxurious life. 
You've a good name in society. 
Good. 
Did you see how time changes a human being? 
Time acts as medicine for any type of sorrow. 
To whom you're sending the mail so seriously? - Divya.
She plays a vital role in my life. 
Because I failed in love, I was terribly upset & was living in Coimbatore.
What all you had said just now. 
All credits goes to that girl. 
She only made me to identify myself. 
After you came and saw me. 
I spent 2 years in Coimbatore with my parents. 
I was struggling to get a foot-hold in life. 
I came to Chennai in search of a job. 
Time gave me new experiences and new friends. 
You're Mr.Senthil, right? - Yes sir. Please come. 
By the by he's Mr.Ganesh Babu, supervisor in M.R.F.
Nowadays, water is having a sewage smell. 
He is Mr.Umapathy, practising law in high court. 
I'm Velmurugan. 
I've a big office 'Vel Associates' in Parrys corner.
I've my own business. 
Don't think I'm fabricating. 
3 of us are jobless fellows. We are all wastrels without jobs.
You're going to buy us morning breakfast. 
Unemployment and poverty have been our constant companions.

We're roaming around on empty stomachs. How can we give donatioin to her?
How did she hit upon us to donate? 
This is the main dish and this is side dish. 
Please give me 2 more pieces. 
Since I've walked from morning, I'm very hungry. 
Have it. 
Each flower tells... 
Life is a battle field. 
Each flower tells that life is a battle field. 
Each dawn declares, 
that there will be a day if there's a night... 
We should've confidence in life. 
We'll achieve our goal one day. 
Oh heart! Reform... 
Whether it is mountain or dew drops... face them! 
Our hearts should never lose hope. 
You shouldn't get depressed in life. 
Tell me, who doesn't have sorrows? Time will erase all your sorrows.

Stones which bear the chisel, become statues in our lives.

The heart which bears sorrows, will savour endless happiness.

All are struggling in life. Why're you shedding tears?

If you work hard to achieve your goal, one day you'll achieve it.
Let us recite the poem of life. 
Let us measure the sky's height. 
Let us always keep trying! 
Our eyes are full of dreams, and our hearts are full of goals.

There's no one to defeat you. You fight against your life confidently!!

Of human! You sow seeds in your heart, it'll become big trees.

Your insults and everything else will become manure!
Can there be any history without defeats? 
Oh friend! Why're you getting worried? 
If you take a clear & good decision, you can achieve the sky!
Please read it. 
Please read it. 
Greetings. 
We didn't give this pamplet saying, 
My father died in the army.. 
My mother is suffering from Paralyses. 
I'm born deaf. 
We're not begging for financial help. 
This is our address. 
We're all jobless degree holders. 
I'm B.Sc, he's M.Com.. 
He knows photography. 
He is B.Sc. 
We didn't find any job in this city. 
Anyone here can be a big business magnet,

Or you might be knowing job opportunities elsewhere.
Whatever job it is... 
Let it be in far-flung area.. 
If you inform us on the address which we had given you,
and if we get that job because of you. 
We'll be benefited a lot. 
We'll be happy. Thank you. 
We've got some letters. 
Hold this. 
She is the one who sang in that program that day, didn't she?
I'm Divya. 
Senthil, Velumurugan, right? Come on... 
Please wait. I'll call you after talking to MD. 
All are fair chicks. 
Buddy, did they give birth to them or made them? - Hey shut up.
Divya told me everything. 
As you've approached differently for a job. 
If you use your creativity for the prosperity of this company,
your life will improve. 
Sir, so are we appointed? 
These days not even own brothers help. 
Being a stranger you took initiative to provide us job.- Don't get emotional.

You put your efforts in your work, and come up in life.
The interest which they've while joining the job, 
they lose it, after they get the job. 
Yes madam. - I hope you won't be like that. 
Sure madam. - You come and join the duty tomorrow.- Thanks madam.
What's it? 
You scoundrel. This's my hard earned money. 
Have you ever seen Rs.5000 in a lump sum? 
Quarter? Oh god. 
You're very funny. 
I'll buy one full bottle. Let's enjoy in the night.
Yes, buy chicken & meat. 
Did I raise my voice a little? - Not a little, too much.
If I ask her, she'll talk in high-flown English. 
She showed her long face for asking her address. 
That is different, this's regarding party. What's it?- It's nothing.
You were trying to say something. - It's nothing. 
We got our salary Rs.5000 because of your benevolence.

That's why, we would like to have a small.. - We would like to give you a treat.
What's the treat? 
Anything. 
You'll offer me also one full bottle? 
Rs.500 which you spend for giving me a treat, 
let us donate this to the Blind school in Adyar. 
Rs.500 which we 3 spend for one square meal, 
there 50 people will have 3 square meals. 
One minute. 
Divya come.- Yes sir. 
How's it going on? 
It's going on well, sir. 
Will you finish it today? 
We can, can't we?- Sure sir. We can. 
A new client. 
It's an advertisement for jewellary. 
I'll tell you a simple and good concept. 
The concept is...- Tell me sir. 
They've come to see a bride. 
She hasn't worn any jewels. 
So, no alliance is fixed. 
After wearing these jewels, groom people accept her.
How is it? Is it okay? 
Good sir. 
Look you can't judge this. Go and prepare the project report.
Senthil, do you've a headache? 
The concept of our M.D. - What's it now? 
I don't like it. 
Are you going to suggest some other idea? Do your duty Senthil.
Divya, I can't do any work which I don't like. 
How is it possible? 
A bride isn't accepted when she isn't wearing jewels.

If she's accepted after wearing jewels, Won't it look cheap?

Then will no husband admire his wife, if she doesn't wear jewels?

Divya, I've transferred 3 tapes. Time is up, let's go.
I've work, you go...I'll come. 
I'll wait for you, come on. 
Why? You've finished your work, right? Then go. 
We have been talking in the office, haven't we? 
So? Why do you want to talk to me after office hours?

If a girl moves with you in a friendly manner, that's all!

You'll accompany her while coming & leaving the office.
You forget your personal matters. 
Why did you come to Madras? 
To roam around with me? 
You've so many things to learn. Search and learn them.
You know to find fault in M.D's idea, isn't it? 
How to work it out? What to do about it? 
If you want to become an AD-maker, 
think what all you should do to upgrade it? 
Don't waste your time in talking to me. 
6 months course. Regarding computer and videos. 
This is the address, evening 7 to 8. 
You can go there after office hours. You will find time,
if you want to come up in life. 
If men don't come up in life inspite of being talented.

is like keeping a Piano which can generate 1000's of tunes, in a show case.
I can't bear it. 
Are you surprised to see me here? 
I've been behaving with you roughly for the past one week.
If you get upset because of that... that's why... 
This is Divya. But she has   another face also. 
 That day she took me to her house.  
Come inside. 
That is the 1st time, I went to her house. 
Just a minute, I'll be back. 
Oh god, I knew you'll do like this. 
Why did you get up? 
Wait. 
I would've done it. Why did you do it? 
Why have you stopped? Remove your shoes & come inside.
Senthil, sit down...I'll come. 
Didn't you eat in the afternoon? Everything is remaining as it is.
Wipe it off. Remove your shirt. It's wet. 
What will I wear? You wear my Nightie. 
Stay here, go in the morning. - No. 
Is no one inside? Who is inside? 
Come... 
Mother... 
Didn't I tell you one person has come to see you? 
Didn't I tell about Senthil? Here he is.. 
My mother. 
What? Do you want to say'greetings'? 
It seems she wants to great you. 
He wanted to come to our house for a long time. 
That's why I brought him here. 
What's it mother? Are you feeling hungry? 
You want him to eat. She's asking you to eat. 
Okay, I'll cook for him also. You take rest. 
Come Senthil. 
You were eager to see me & my happiness, weren't you?
Have your seen? Sit down. 
That's it. This's the secret of my life. Is it enough?
Divya, I'll take leave. - You go tomorrow. 
Mother did Senthil come here? 
Clean everything and get your remaining payment tomorrow.
Okay sir. 
Did you take leave from the office only for this? 
Who asked you to do all these things? 
Senthil, I don't like all these things. - Shut up! 
You did everything what all I needed without asking me,
did you do it after knowing my wish? 
You did it for my welfare, didn't you? 
Hereafter you should be happy. 
Don't talk anything more. 
I'm very much worried about my mother. 
My father met with an accident. 
My mother struggled a lot to bring me up. 
Suddenly, she became sick. 
Then she got Paralyses. 
Senthil, I suffered a lot.. 
While taking oil bath... 
When I see others applying Henna... 
When I wish to go to the temple... 
I miss my mother a lot! 
Beautiful drawing, isn't it? It was drawn by artist 'Marudhu'.

I like his art very much.- Give me a ticket for Devaki Hospital.
Are you Divya?- How are you sister? 
I'm fine how about you? 
Are you taking your medicines properly?- Yes. 
Has your tablet course finished?- Yes. 
You come again for check up. 
Won't you ask what we talked about? 
You would've told me, if it was necessary, right? 
Why do you take treatment? 
Cancer. 
Don't lie. You can't get cancer. 
Tell me the truth, why do you take treatment? 
Why can't I get cancer? I'm going to die shortly. 
Are you joking? 
You'll not die. You can't die. 
You will not. Please why do you take treatment? Tell me.
I would've died, 
One year ago. 
I attempted for committing suicide. I took poison. 
I was destined to meet you. 
That's why I was saved. 
Love failure. 
How's it? For what? 
That isn't considered love. 
I moved with a wrong person, so I was cheated. 
Divya, what happened? 
Sorry, I got late. 
Why're you looking dull? Tell me. 
I met him.- Whom? 
Sundar. 
Why're you laughing? Tell me. 
I imagined what could have happened. 
What could have happened? Tell me.. 
He would have told you that what he did was wrong, 
and that he is not able to forget you. 
and that he is still loving you. 
Being a woman, without knowing what to do. You would've hesitated.
Am I right? 
It's very common in love. 
Are you my friend? 
Shit! 
Sorry.- Okay no problem. 
Earlier when I used to meet him, my hands will shiver & heart will palpitate.
I had also walked home crying all the way. 
But today I faced him boldly, 
and said "what had happened has happened". 
"there's no relationship between you & me". "you don't meet me ever".
I had told him bravely. How's it possible? 
I was thinking about it on the way. 
From where did I get this strength? I was not like this earlier.
I was a coward. I used to get scared a lot. 
Now as you're... 
But now, I've become brave because of your support.

I'm confident that my friend will support me in any eventuality.
Go man... 
You're my friend. 
How I'm now and how I was in Coimbatore. 
There's a lot of change in me. 
In those days, I always used to remember my Lathika.
Now...some times... very rarely I remember her. 
That's because of your friendship. 
Senthil, our minds are like that only. 
If we keep on worrying about a thing. 
Then we'll not be able to come out of it. 
If we change our place and mingle with other people.
Our sorrows will disappear. 
Change is a permanent thing in life. 
When I looked at east, 
oh my dear friend, you were like my dawn. 
Oh lovable friend, you came like breeze through my window.

Oh my friend, when I'm alone you accompanied me with your remembrance.
I was reborn because of you. 
Oh friend, my heart became pure because of your friendship.

A good friend is a good library. I understood it after seeing you.
Is it your smile, rain? It is drenching my heart. 
Is your vision, dew drops? My eye lids are closed. 
The water which is poured in the root also gives life to the flower.

When you're getting excited, it's making me also happy.
You'll get a rebirth, if you have a friend. 
Till now I didn't know this truth. 
Change is permanent thing in life. 
Oh friend, I realised this fact, because of you. 
Oh friend, even if creator Brahma asks you, I'll not give you to him.
Trust worthy. Truthfulness. Culture. 
It's a Jewel Palace owned by a smart person. "Balu Jewellers".
That last sound track was non-sync. 
When I was correcting it, you came here. 
That's final...? - Yes sir. 
It's very nice.- Thank you sir. 
Senthil, last time the Ad which we had sent to Bombay was appreciated.
They've asked us to do the next Ad. 
We'll do it. 
It seems they want it next month itself. 
This time you're going to make a script and shoot it.
If you do it perfectly, 
you can do all other forthcoming Ad's of our company.
Okay?- Certainly sir. 
Your involvement, interest, hard work has only made you to come up in life.
Thank you sir.- Keep it up. 
When I say I'm thirsty, you're giving me a young tree.

When I say I'm feeling hungry, You're giving me paddy.
When I hold your hands & walk, I get confidence. 
When I walk along with you, I also see the 9th direction.
You'll be my guide in all my journeys. 
Divya, I've planned everything for that Bombay project.- Okay.

But you should be with me for those 2 days. - Then what about office?

I asked M.D. He laughed & gave permission to take you.

Don't forget Divya. You should be with me for those 2 days.
I can work nicely if you near me. 
Okay, I'll definitely be with you. 
Okay Divya? 
What do you want? - Why're you looking dull? 
It's nothing. 
Go and check that photo's position. 
On the screen. - No, on the wall. 
What's it? 
We've to select a towel.. they've brought another one.
Where's it? Ask him to bring that. 
We've to finish this by tomorrow, right? 
If I go home, I'll keep talking with my mother. 
Then it will get late. 
Tomorrow you needn't come to my house. 
I'll directly come to the floor. 
You go earlier and check the lighting. 
If we complete it quickly, M.D will be happy. 
Driver stop the vehicle near that shop.- Yes. 
I've to buy certain things, bye. 
See you. 
Hey Senthil, what's it? 
Why're you getting angry? 
There's no time, we've got to finish this before evening.

Nothing will work, if you get tensed like this. Ready...cheer up.

It's been long time since we've seen mother, right?

When mother hears about my 1st shooting, she'll be happy, isn't it?
Divya, what happened? 
Mother... 
When I started from home for the station.... 
Mother, I've prepared breakfast and kept coffee in the flask.
Today Senthil is going to shoot for the 1st time. 
Mother... 
Mother... 
Mother... 
What're you talking Divya? 
Hereafter I can't see my mother. 
Being a girl, 
you've completed all the rituals of your mother in the night itself.
You'll live happily. 
Your mother will always be with you. 
I'll take leave.- See you madam. 
Senthil let's go. 
Divya you've done a great mistake. Without revealing it to anyone.
You did everything for me. 
How can you do like this Divya? 
Divya how did you get that courage? 
Divya, why did you hide? Why did you hide from me? 
My friend should win. 
I've lost my mother. 
I didn't want to stop your 1st shooting by telling you this.
And I didn't want to spoil your life. 
Divya's life became a question mark. 
Divya has no relatives.- Oh mother! 
We were worried how Divya is going to stay alone. 
I and friends decided to make her stay with us, 
and we asked Divya about it. 
When we were in the darkness, 
she was the one who gave us a candle & showed light on our paths.

The light which she had chosen to remove her darkness was different.
I'm fine, how about you? 
Are you going to study? 
Mr.Senthil, this place and people are not strangers for Divya.
She has been coming here for the past 10 years. 
Don't worry. Divya will be safe here. 
I can assure you. 
Senthil, are you angry with me? 
'Separation' is a usual thing in life. 
Don't mistake me. 
Okay, bye.- Bye. 
All other relationships are created by others, 
only in friendship, we choose friends according to our wish.
I found you like that only. 
I don't want to confine my good friendship into an ordinary bondage.

As a friend, you share all my happiness and sorrows.
You share all my feelings. 
You're going to be with me through out my life, 
I need you as my best friend! 
Senthil, it's very difficult to get good friends in life.
There shouldn't be any friction between us. 
We shouldn't get separated ever. 
Very interesting girl. I want to meet her after learning about her.
You'll come to the marriage, won't you? 
I'll introduce her at that time, meet her. 
Shall we go to Lathika's house & come?- Why? 
I want to meet her. 
I want to tell her that I'm happy. 
She will be happy if she sees me happy, right? 
I want to invite her for my marriage. 
No Senthil. 
She would've forgotten you by this time. 
If we kindle her past memories again, 
and if she looks at you in a strange manner, it won't be nice.
Don't... 
No, I want to meet her. 
Her face full of tears is only imprinted on my heart,

when I get her remembrance, that face disturbs me a lot.
Now she is happy, isn't it? 
If I see her face, my past memories will be erased..

I'll also start my new life without any guilty conscience.
Even if you don't come, I'm going to meet her. 
Who's it?- We want to meet Lathika. 
Come inside. 
6 months after I had met you, 
Lathika's husband Madhavan participated in the boat race taken place here.

In that boat race, people attacked him & threw him in the water.
Next day his dead body was found. 
After seeing that incident & the misfortune of Lathika
All were in great shock. 
Lathika's father also felt guilty since he charted a wrong future for his daughter,
and he died 4 years hence. 
Lathika lost all her relations & became lonely. 
But she made me promise not to reveal her tragedies to you.
From that day onwards, she's living in music. 
I can't control myself. I think I've done a grave wrong.
Senthil, Lathika has come. 
Now no use of cry... 
There's no use of crying now, Senthil. 
12 years have passed. 
I never expected that I'll see you again. 
Now when I saw you... 
That too when I saw you with wedding invitations, 
I felt very happy. 
You're entering a new life by forgetting me and the past.
I'm very happy to see that. 
You were very happy when you came here, 
go back with the same happiness.- No. 
I don't want happiness. 
I don't want. 
You will feel sad. 
After I got separated from you. 
I also experienced the same agony for 2 years. 
I also struggled a lot to forget you.. 
As days passed, I got used to it. 
Now...Now I'm not getting your remembrance. 
Truly I had forgotten you. 
You forget me. Are you still the same? 
Did you come here with the same love which you had for me?
It isn't because of love, you're crying for me. 
It's sympathy. 
You're crying out of sympathy that I've become alone.
Sometimes we have to bear practical things. 
Everyone has some wounds which never heal. 
We can only console them. Can't cure their wounds. 
Senthil, I'm used to living alone. 
You don't worry about me. 
The girl which you're going to marry, 
Start a happy life with that girl. 
We've only destined this much in this birth. 
Hello, Is Divya there? 
Is it very easy to stop the marriage? 
We've given invitations to everyone. 
Now if marriage is stopped, 
did you ever think how that bride's life will be affected?

Now what're you going to do after stopping the marriage?
Lathika is in distress. 
If there's any problem to Kamala. 
Will you allow her inside your house? 
Past is past Senthil. 
We're still living having gone through all these types of sorrows.

Like you, every human being will have some past memories.

They'll forget them & lead a life with their families.
Because that is being practical! 
We can only be like that. 
Senthil, there're so many other things in life than love.

In 60 years of our life span, we are struggling 30 years for finance.
In that struggle... 
These sorrows, failures disappear. 
Please don't get confused. 
You didn't purposely cheat her. It's all our destiny.
You frequently chant God's name, right? 
That god has only cheated. 
You didn't commit any mistake. 
Take the bride. 
If you wear this, you'll not look like a groom. 
You wear this apparel.... - please dad...don't force me.
He's telling you, isn't it? Wear... 
No uncle, if I wear this. I'll look like the person selling'sompapdi'.
Why is he so stubborn? - Atleast you wear this. 
Excuse me, haida. 
Come Divya.- It seems, groom is getting ready. 
Why're you so late?- Congrats. 
Sorry, I got caught in a traffic jam. I've come, didn't I?
How can you get caught in a traffic jam? 
Hey wear this...Wear it. 
Dad, only if I wear gold, I'll be called as groom? Divya tell him.

Father is telling you, isn't it? Wear. You wear it...
You put it on him. 
Have you come to support him? 
If you wear it, you'll look like a groom. 
Clap hands. 
You carry on, I'll be back. 
Since bride is fair and beautiful. He got stumped. 
What do you've? Why're you doing like this? 
Is it? Does bride look very beautiful? 
Let's see. Take me to her. - He's lying.- Take me, 
Do you want to see her?- Yes... - Take her. 
What? Hey you take me man.- Come on.. 
Excuse me, sorry my friends wants to see you. 
Hey Latha, he's the groom. 
Meet my friends!- Hi. 
She wants to meet you.- What? 
Will you give respect to her after marriage also? 
Sorry? I'll go... 
You come...hey come. 
Okay bye. 
Hey he's going, ask him! 
Will you ask? Or shall I? 
Excuse me, just a minute. 
I want to talk to you.- I.. 
Bride wants to talk something... Go man... Don't feel shy...go.
Come let's go. 
Oh god, ask him... 
Have you failed in love? 
My friends asked "Has your husband-to-be failed in love",

"that's why he's having beard at the time of marriage also".
That's why, I asked. 
Sorry, don't mistake me. 
Since my friends teased you, I asked you out of curiosity.
What? 
Beard? 
Hey, I'll give you a rap. 
Where have you made them to stay? 
Greetings...welcome... 
Senthil, are you fine?- You're coming only now?- Yes. Take them inside.

So wish you a happy married life! 
You didn't buy anything for me? 
Why gifts between friends? Shake hand! 
Congrats.- Thank you.
